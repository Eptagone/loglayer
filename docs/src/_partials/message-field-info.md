::: info Message field name
The output examples use `msg` as the message field. The name of this field may vary depending on the logging library you are using.
In the `console` logger, this field does not exist by default, and the message is printed directly. However, you can configure the console transport to use a message field - see the [Console Transport](/transports/console) documentation for more details.
